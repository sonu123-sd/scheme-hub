    "a1": "Scheme Hub is a comprehensive digital platform that provides information about Central and State Government schemes in India. It helps citizens discover, understand, and apply for various welfare programs.",
    "q2": "Is Scheme Hub an official government website?",
    "a2": "Scheme Hub is an information portal that aggregates data from official government sources. For authoritative information and actual applications, we redirect users to the respective official ministry or department websites.",
    "q3": "Is Scheme Hub free to use?",
    "a3": "Yes, Scheme Hub is completely free to use. You can browse schemes, check eligibility, and access all features without any charges.",
    "q4": "How does the eligibility checker work?",
    "a4": "Our eligibility checker uses the information you provide (age, income, state, category, etc.) to match you with schemes whose criteria you potentially meet. It's a guidance tool - final eligibility is determined by the concerned authorities.",
    "q5": "Why am I not eligible for any schemes?",
    "a5": "Eligibility depends on various factors like age, income, location, and category. Try adjusting your profile information or browse all schemes to find ones that might suit your situation.",
    "q6": "Can I apply for schemes from other states?",

    "q7": "How do I apply for a scheme?",
    "a7": "When you click 'Apply Now' on a scheme page, you'll be redirected to the official application portal. Scheme Hub provides information and guidance but doesn't process applications directly.",

    "a8": "Common documents include Aadhaar card, income certificate, caste certificate, residence proof, and bank details. Each scheme has specific requirements listed on its detail page.",

    "q11": "How are my documents stored?",
    "a11": "Documents you upload are stored locally in your browser. They are not uploaded to any external server. This means you'll need to re-upload if you use a different device.",
